package com.java.StringDefaultMethods;
//compareTo() :  Compares 2 strings lexicographically.
//============

// Points to Note here are:
//=============================

// 1) Comparison is based on the uncode value of each character in a String.

// 2) The method returns,

//     --> 0 if the String is equal to the other String.

//     --> >0 (Greater than 0) if the String is lexographically greater than the other string.

//     --> <0 (Less than 0) if the String is lexographically  less than the other string.

// 3) use compareToIgnoreCase(): to compare two strings lexongraphically , ignoring lowercase and uppercase differences.

// 4) use equals() method to compare two strings without consideration of unicode values.
